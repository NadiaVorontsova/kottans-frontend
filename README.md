## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1. Linux Survival (4 modules):

It's easy for me because I studied it at university, but these quizzes helped me recall some of the commands!
I suppose i will use all commands except commands for printing.

- [Quiz 3](/assets/img/task_linux_cli/Quiz3.jpg)
- [Quiz 4](/assets/img/task_linux_cli/Quiz4.jpg)

2. HTTP:

I have already used HTTP requests in my project for studying but i used just get, post, update and delete methods.
I will continue to explore this theme specifically how to work with headers.

## Git Collaboration

If i had watched week 3 and 4 in Introduction to Git and GitHub on Coursera several days ago I would not have had problems with PR.
I will need this information in the future. 
I like that the lessons were in English because it can help me improve my level but it was not always so easy to understand him.

2. Learn HTML and CSS

- [Learn HTML and CSS](/assets/img/task_html_css_intro/CodecademyHtmlCss.jpg)

I have already worked with HTML and there was nothing new for me but what about CSS...
Finally i undertood how to use box-sizing property and relative and how to work with relative and absolute element positioning.
Until this moment I did not know about such a property as clear.
I have already used responsive design with the Bootstrap Grid System, so this was the easy part of this course and i will use it in the future because i find that it is a simple way to make site adaptive.
I found out how to correct work with fonts.
<br/>
In addition, I found many resources which can help me, for example jsfiddle, codepen, css-tricks, caniuse, validator.w3, csszengarden.

## Responsive Web Design

Very interesting material, I specially liked the videos of Lifestyle freelancer blogger. He speaks clearly and understandably.
<br/>
I will use this knowledge;)

## HTML-CSS-Popup

[Demo](https://nadiavorontsova.github.io/hooli-style-popup/) |
[Code base](https://github.com/NadiaVorontsova/hooli-style-popup)

It was very interesting for me. I understood how to work with CSS flex and grid. Learned using pseudo-classes and customize checkboxes. I had a lot of mistakes but with the help of mentors i improved my code:)

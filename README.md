## Git та GitHub

My name is Nadia. I am 21y.o.
I have used Git for studying before but this material were very useful for me.
I have known how to move between branches and work with remote repository.
I think i will use all of these commands.

I used to study:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

- [Introduction to Git and GitHub Week 2](/assets/img/Git_intro/UsingGit.jpg)

I went through the levels here learngitbranching.js.org:

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1. Linux Survival (4 modules):

It's easy for me because I studied it at university, but these quizzes helped me recall some of the commands!
I suppose i will use all commands except commands for printing.

- [Quiz 2](/assets/img/task_linux_cli/Quiz2.jpg)
- [Quiz 3](/assets/img/task_linux_cli/Quiz3.jpg)
- [Quiz 4](/assets/img/task_linux_cli/Quiz4.jpg)

2. HTTP:

I have already used HTTP requests in my project for studying but i used just get, post, update and delete methods.
I will continue to explore this theme specifically how to work with headers.
